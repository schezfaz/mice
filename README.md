## :hear_no_evil:  What's all the excitement about?  
Mice is a python script which moves your mouse at regular intervals to ensure that your employer measures your productivitiy correctly :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:. Ever had those days where you have the blues or a hangover :beers: and you just cannot work. So you stay in bed watching netflix or idling away. Then you get a call from your boss asking you things which are not his business. 

Mice helps you pretend to be online while you deal with that god aweful hangover in peace. <br/><br/><br/>

## Usage 
* Ensure all packages mentioned in requirements.txt are installed
* Just run mouse.py and leave it running in the background. The mouse is moved at random intervals within a max time of 5 mins, to a random point on the screen
